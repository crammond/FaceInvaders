# Face Invaders

This is a Space Invaders clone I made for my AP Computer Science final in High School. I have created this repo to preserve the game as I wrote it in my early programming days, and also to maybe fix and update the game.

## Development

This project is configured for convenient development in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

### Running

The default Run Configuration "SpaceGameDriver" can be run in IntelliJ with the green play button.
