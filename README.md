# Face Invaders

This is a Space Invaders clone I made for my AP Computer Science final in High School. I have created this repo to preserve the game as I wrote it in my early programming days, and also to maybe fix and update the game.

## Running

I believe Eclipse 4.16 is the latest version with Java Applet support and can be downloaded [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-06/r).

After opening the project, click the dropdown next to the Green run button and Select Run As > Java Applet.
